This directory contains the coordinate files for PEDOT-rich grains,
generated by MC simulation. Additionally, the directory contains two scripts:
  - m.f (Fortran95 file).
  - coords2pdb.py (python 3.8 file).

The file m.f generates replicate configurations of PEDOT-rich grains in a film
via MC simulation. It outputs the xyz coordinates of different numbers of 
particles. For each particle number, there are 24 replicates:
      
  fort.1101 to fort.1124  --> 1301  particles   
  fort.1201 to fort.1224  -->  760  particles   
  fort.1301 to fort.1324  -->  449  particles   
  fort.1401 to fort.1424  -->  247  particles   

m.f can be compiled with "gfortran m.f -o sim.exe" and run with "./sim.exe".
The number of particles can be adjusted in m.f.

The file coords2pdb.py converts a coordinate file produced by m.f
(e.g. "fort.1401") to a pdb file format.
