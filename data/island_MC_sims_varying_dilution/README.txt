This directory contains the coordinate files for PEDOT-rich grains,
generated by MC simulation. There are three subdirectories:
  - island_0.55
  - island_0.675
  - island_0.8.

Each contains 24 configurations (generated via MC simulation) for four 
different PEDOT-to-PSS weight ratios. The trailing decimal (e.g. 0.55) 
corresponds to the assumed volume fraction of PEDOT-rich grains in the 
film (see Supporting Information for additional detail).

Additionally, the directory contains two scripts:

  - m.f (Fortran95 file).
  - coords2pdb.py (python 3.8 file).

The file m.f generates replicate configurations of PEDOT-rich grains in a film
via MC simulation. It outputs the xyz coordinates of different numbers of 
particles. For each particle number, there are 24 replicates:
      
  fort.1101 to fort.1124  --> 1301  particles   
  fort.1201 to fort.1224  -->  760  particles   
  fort.1301 to fort.1324  -->  449  particles   
  fort.1401 to fort.1424  -->  247  particles   

m.f can be compiled with "gfortran m.f -o sim.exe" and run with "./sim.exe".
It requires the file fort.99, which is a set of random initial positions.
The number of particles in each simulation can be adjusted in m.f.

The file coords2pdb.py converts a coordinate file produced by m.f
(e.g. "fort.1401") to a pdb file format.
