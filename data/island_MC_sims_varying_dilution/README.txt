This directory contains the coordinate files for PEDOT-rich grains,
generated by MC simulation. Additionally, the directory contains two scripts:
  - m.f (Fortran95 file).
  - coords2pdb.py (python 3.8 file).
The descriptions of these files can be found in ~/data/island_MC_sims/README.txt.

There are three subdirectories here:
  - island_0.55
  - island_0.675
  - island_0.8.

Each contains 24 configurations (generated via MC simulation) for four 
different PEDOT-to-PSS weight ratios. The trailing decimal (e.g. 0.55) 
corresponds to the assumed volume fraction of PEDOT-rich grains in the 
film (see Supporting Information for additional detail).
