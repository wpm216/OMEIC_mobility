This directory contains the GROMACS files used to simulate the PSS-rich matrix.

Directories include:
  1. mdps       : all .mdp files used in simulation (with a README)
  2. pdbs       : .pdb files of individual molecules used in simulations
  3. topologies : GROMACS topology files of individual molecules

Files include:
  1. film.top                 : simulation topology file
  2. example_initial_gas.gro  : example initial configruation (can be generated by
                                  gmx insert-molecules)
  3. film.ndx                 : .ndx file for post analysis
  4. example_film.gro         : example configuration of annealed film
